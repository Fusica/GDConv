# When Dynamic Convolution meets Ghost Features
!(https://raw.github.com/Fusica/GDConv.git/main/title.png)
This repository is a PyTorch implementation of our  paper: When Dynamic Convolution meets Ghost Features

We will disclose the full code once the paper has been accepted.

In the classification experiment, the code for ResNet and MobileNetV2 comes from https://github.com/WZMIAOMIAO/deep-learning-for-image-processing.git

In the detection experiment, the YOLOv5 code comes from https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5, the YOLOv7 code comes from https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7, and the YOLOv8 code comes from https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics.git.
